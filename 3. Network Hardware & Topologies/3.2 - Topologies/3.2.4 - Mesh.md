## What is Mesh Topology?

<img align="right" src="images/MESH.png" width="240px" alt="MESH" />

**Mesh Topology = every device is connected to every other device.**  

Imagine a **spider web**, but every point connects directly to all others — not just the center.  
Data can take **multiple paths** to reach its destination.

> “Hey, I can reach you in 3 ways or 5 ways, pick whichever is fastest!”  
> Devices: “Cool, no single path can block me.”

## How devices connect?

- **Full Mesh:** Every device connected to every other device.  
- **Partial Mesh:** Some devices connect fully, others selectively.  
- Highly **redundant**, so network rarely fails.

## Pros of Mesh Topology

| Feature | Why it’s cool |
|---------|---------------|
| Fault-tolerant | One link fails → data reroutes |
| High privacy/security | Direct paths reduce exposure |
| Fast communication | No waiting on hubs/switches |

---

## Cons of Mesh Topology

| Drawback | What it means IRL |
|----------|-----------------|
| Cabling & cost | More connections = expensive & messy |
| Complex setup | Connecting everything manually is a headache |
| Hard to maintain | Troubleshooting all paths can be tricky |

## Where do we find it?

- Wireless Mesh Networks (some smart home Wi-Fi)  
- Critical infrastructure (data centers, military networks)  
- MANs or WANs with redundancy requirements

## Real-Life Analogy

Think of a **group chat where everyone is directly friends with everyone else**.  
- You can message anyone without going through a central admin  
- One person drops out → doesn’t break the conversation 🕸️

## Summary

- Mesh topology = **direct connections between all devices**  
- Full vs Partial mesh depending on redundancy needs  
- Expensive & complex but super reliable  
- Popular in **wireless networks** and **mission-critical setups**
