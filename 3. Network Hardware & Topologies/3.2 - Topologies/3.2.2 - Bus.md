## What is Bus Topology?

**Bus Topology = all devices share a single communication line (the bus).**  

Think of it like a **single road** where every car (device) drives back and forth. Only **one car can pass at a time**, and everyone listens to the same road.  

> ‚ÄúHey guys, my data‚Äôs coming down the road!‚Äù  
> Everyone: ‚ÄúYup, got it‚Ä¶ if it‚Äôs for me.‚Äù

## How devices connect?

- All devices connect to **one common backbone cable**.
- Data travels in **both directions** along the bus.
- Terminators at each end prevent **signal bounce** (imagine putting bumpers at the ends of the road so cars don‚Äôt crash).

## Pros of Bus Topology

| Feature | Why it‚Äôs cool |
|---------|---------------|
| Simple setup | Only one cable to lay down |
| Cost-effective | Less cabling than star |
| Easy to extend | Add a device anywhere along the bus |

## Cons of Bus Topology

| Drawback | What it means IRL |
|----------|-----------------|
| Collisions happen | Two devices sending at same time ‚Üí crash |
| Terminator required | Forget it ‚Üí signals reflect and mess up communication |
| Hard to troubleshoot | One cable fault ‚Üí whole network may stop |
| Not scalable | Too many devices ‚Üí slow & chaotic |

## Where do we find it?

- Small networks back in the 80s‚Äì90s (before switches became cheap)  
- Temporary setups / labs  
- Bus topology is **rare in modern networks**, mostly historical learning

## Real-Life Analogy

Imagine **everyone shouting on a single street**. Only one message travels at a time.  
If the street is blocked, everyone‚Äôs communication halts. üöß

## Summary

- Bus topology = **all devices share a single backbone**  
- Cheap & simple but prone to collisions & failure  
- Largely replaced by **Star/Switched networks**
