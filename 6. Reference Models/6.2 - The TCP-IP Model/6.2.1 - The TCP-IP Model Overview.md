## What is TCP/IP?

**TCP/IP = Transmission Control Protocol / Internet Protocol** model.  
It‚Äôs the *practical framework* that the internet actually uses to move data around.  

`Think of it like a 4-floor building ‚Äî fewer floors than OSI, but each one does more work.`  

While OSI is more of a teaching guide, **TCP/IP is the real deal** behind the modern internet.

## The 4 Layers (Top to Bottom)

Layer | Name | What it Does | Examples
---|---|---|---
4Ô∏è‚É£ | Application | Where user apps + protocols live | HTTP, HTTPS, DNS, SMTP
3Ô∏è‚É£ | Transport | Ensures data delivery (reliable or fast) | TCP, UDP, Ports
2Ô∏è‚É£ | Internet | Handles addressing + routing | IP, ICMP, ARP
1Ô∏è‚É£ | Network Access | Deals with hardware + transmission | Ethernet, Wi-Fi, MAC, NICs

## Layer Breakdown

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Application Layer  

Where all your apps and protocols hang out. It combines OSI‚Äôs **Application, Presentation, and Session layers** into one.  
**Examples:**  

- HTTP/HTTPS (web)  
- SMTP, IMAP, POP3 (emails)  
- DNS (resolving names to IPs)  
- FTP (file transfers)  

---

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Transport Layer  

Controls *how data is sent*. Same as OSI Transport.  
**Examples:**  

- **TCP**: reliable, ordered (like a postal service with receipts)  
- **UDP**: fast, no guarantees (like yelling into the void)  
- Port numbers: 80, 443, 53, 25  

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Internet Layer  

Chooses where data should go ‚Äî like assigning an address and finding the route.  
**Examples:**  

- IP (IPv4/IPv6)  
- ICMP (ping)  
- ARP (finding MAC addresses)  
- Routing decisions  

---

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Network Access Layer  

Also called **Link Layer**. Handles how data is actually transmitted over wires or wireless.  
**Examples:**  

- Ethernet, Wi-Fi  
- MAC addresses  
- NIC (Network Interface Card)  
- Physical transmission (bits, voltages, signals)  

---

## Mnemonics (to Remember Layers)

From Top to Bottom: üëâ **All Teachers In Network**  
From Bottom to Top: üëâ **Never Ignore Transport Always**  

Not as catchy as OSI pizza mnemonics üçï, but works.

## Real-Life Flow

Here‚Äôs how google.com request works in TCP/IP:  

Action | TCP/IP Layer
---|---
We type google.com | Application  
HTTPS request made | Application  
Data split into TCP segments | Transport  
IP addresses + routing decided | Internet  
Sent via Ethernet/Wi-Fi | Network Access  

Reverse happens at the other end.

## Tools and What Layer They Belong To

Tool / Protocol | TCP/IP Layer
---|---
HTTP, DNS, FTP, SMTP | 4 - Application  
TCP/UDP, Ports | 3 - Transport  
IP, ICMP, ARP | 2 - Internet  
Ethernet, Wi-Fi, MAC | 1 - Network Access  

---

## Why should we care?

Because **troubleshooting often uses TCP/IP, not OSI.**  
When your network is down, you‚Äôll actually be mapping issues on these 4 layers.  

- Browser not loading? Maybe Application layer.  
- Can‚Äôt ping? Internet layer.  
- Wi-Fi down? Network Access layer.  

---

## Summary

TCP/IP is the **internet‚Äôs operating manual**. Unlike OSI, it‚Äôs not just theory ‚Äî it‚Äôs what our devices actually use.  

#### ***"TCP/IP feels easier ‚Äî fewer layers, but each one carries more weight."***  

*Think of OSI as the study notes, and TCP/IP as the actual exam paper.*
