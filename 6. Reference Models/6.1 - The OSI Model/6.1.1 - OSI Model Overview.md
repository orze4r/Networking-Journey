## What is OSI?

**OSI = Open Systems Interconnection** model.  
It‚Äôs a layered model that explains *how data moves from one device to another over a network*.  

`Think of it like a 7-floor building ‚Äî each floor (layer) does its job, passes the box (data) to the next floor. Boom.`

It helps people understand networks better ‚Äî even though in the real world, things might not exactly follow it.

## The 7 Layers (Top to Bottom)

| Layer | Name | What it Does | Examples |
|-------|------|---------------|----------|
| 7Ô∏è‚É£ | Application | Where apps talk to the network | HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, DNS, Gmail |
| 6Ô∏è‚É£ | Presentation | Formats, encrypts, decrypts data | SSL/TLS, JPEG, MP4 |
| 5Ô∏è‚É£ | Session | Opens/closes communication | SSH, NetBIOS, login sessions |
| 4Ô∏è‚É£ | Transport | Splits + sends data reliably | TCP, UDP, Ports |
| 3Ô∏è‚É£ | Network | Chooses routes between devices | IP, Routers, ICMP |
| 2Ô∏è‚É£ | Data Link | Delivers data on local network | Ethernet, MAC Address |
| 1Ô∏è‚É£ | Physical | Actual cables/signals/bits | Copper, Fiber, Wi-Fi, Voltage |

## Layer Breakdown ‚Äî My Brutal Honest Version

### 7Ô∏è‚É£ Application Layer  
This is the level WE interact with ‚Äî Chrome, Firefox, apps, etc.  
It talks to layers below it to send/receive data.  
**Examples:** HTTP, FTP, DNS, Emails, Discord, Google Meet

---

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ Presentation Layer  
Takes raw data and makes it readable or safe.  
Encrypts, compresses, formats data.  
**Examples:**  
- SSL/TLS (used for HTTPS)
- Encoding (JPEG, MP4, JSON)
- Decryption on your device

---

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Session Layer  
Sets up, manages, and ends sessions.  
It keeps track of conversations.  
**Examples:**  
- API sessions  
- Login states  
- Persistent connections  
(usually ignored unless broken)

---

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Transport Layer  
Breaks down large data into smaller parts (segments) and sends them.  
Decides *how* to send: reliably or fast.  
**Examples:**  
- TCP (slow but reliable, like a postman who rings twice)  
- UDP (fast but no guarantee, like tossing paper planes)  
- Port numbers: 80 (HTTP), 443 (HTTPS), 53 (DNS)

---

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Network Layer  
Chooses the path for data to travel. Think routers and IPs.  
**Examples:**  
- IP Addresses (IPv4, IPv6)  
- ICMP (used in ping)  
- Routing decisions (like Google Maps for data)

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Data Link Layer  
Handles communication *within* the local network.  
Sends data to the correct MAC address on the same LAN.  
**Examples:**  
- Ethernet  
- ARP (Address Resolution Protocol)  
- MAC Address (like name tags for devices)

---

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Physical Layer  
This is the wire, the light pulses, the air. The actual thing data travels through.  
**Examples:**  
- Twisted pair (Ethernet), Coaxial, Fiber  
- Wi-Fi radio waves  
- Voltage, light pulses  
- Network Interface Cards (NICs), switches

## Mnemonics (to Remember Layers)

From Top to Bottom:  
üëâ **All People Seem To Need Data Processing**

From Bottom to Top:  
üëâ **Please Do Not Throw Sausage Pizza Away**

They both sound stupid üòÇ, but they work.

## Real-Life Flow

Here's how a simple browser request works through layers:

| Action | OSI Layer |
|--------|-----------|
| We type google.com | Layer 7 (Application) |
| HTTPS encrypts it | Layer 6 (Presentation) |
| Session starts | Layer 5 |
| Data chopped up | Layer 4 (TCP) |
| Router finds route | Layer 3 (IP) |
| MAC address added | Layer 2 (Ethernet) |
| Sent as voltage | Layer 1 (Physical) |

Then reverse all that on the other side. Every. Single. Time.

## Tools and What Layer They Belong To

| Tool / Protocol | OSI Layer |
|------------------|------------|
| HTTP, DNS, FTP   | 7 - Application |
| TLS/SSL          | 6 - Presentation |
| SSH, NetBIOS     | 5 - Session |
| TCP/UDP, Ports   | 4 - Transport |
| IP, ICMP, Ping   | 3 - Network |
| MAC, ARP         | 2 - Data Link |
| Ethernet, Wi-Fi  | 1 - Physical |

---

## Why should we care?

Because when something breaks ‚Äî like our Wi-Fi, DNS, or website ‚Äî **knowing which layer failed** helps fix it faster.

- Can't reach google.com? Might be DNS (Layer 7)  
- Slow file download? Might be TCP (Layer 4)  
- Ethernet light off? Layer 1, baby.

## Summary

OSI Model is like the IKEA instruction manual of the internet.  
Not always followed, but damn helpful when something breaks or you‚Äôre trying to *look smart* during an interview.

#### ***"OSI Model can be easy to understand for some people, easier to remember while I am still stuck at Presentation and Session Layers"***

 *Without this model, trying to understand networking is like fixing a car with your eyes closed.*
