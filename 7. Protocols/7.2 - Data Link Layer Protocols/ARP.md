## What is ARP?

**ARP = Address Resolution Protocol**

ARP is like a **nosy neighbor** in a LAN:

> ‚ÄúI know your IP‚Ä¶ but I don‚Äôt know where you live.  
> WHO has this IP? Please give me your MAC address!‚Äù

And boom ‚Äî the device replies with its **MAC address**.

That‚Äôs what ARP does:  
**Finds the MAC address** of a device **when you only have its IP**.

---

## Why ARP Exists?

Because computers work on layers.

- **IP address** = where the device is logically (like its postal code)
- **MAC address** = actual hardware identity (like house number)

If I want to send something on a LAN, I **need the MAC**, not just the IP.

---

## Real Example:

My laptop wants to send data to `192.168.1.15`, but it doesn‚Äôt know the MAC.

It shouts on the network:

> ‚ÄúWho has 192.168.1.15? Tell me your MAC!‚Äù

If that device is active, it says:

> ‚ÄúYo, that‚Äôs me ‚Äî my MAC is AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF‚Äù

Then my laptop updates its ARP table and sends the frame directly to that MAC address.

## ARP Table

Every device keeps a mini-diary called the **ARP Table**, like:

| IP Address       | MAC Address           |
|------------------|-----------------------|
| 192.168.1.1      | AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:01     |
| 192.168.1.15     | AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF     |

## We can view it using:

| Bash       | OS/System           |
|------------------|-----------------------|
| arp -a      | Windows     |
| ip neigh     | Linux/Termux (Android)     |

## Summary of What It Does


| Thing       | What it Means           |
|------------------|-----------------------|
| ARP Request      | "Who has this IP?" (broadcasted)     |
| ARP Reply        | "That's me. Here's my MAC."     |
| ARP Table        | IP-to-MAC diary my system keeps |
| Purpose          | Allow devices to talk in LAN using MAC addresses |

## ARP Spoofing (Dark Side)

Some shady guy on your network can lie:

> ‚ÄúHey! That IP? Yeah, that‚Äôs me. Send your data to me.‚Äù



Boom. You‚Äôre now the man in the middle.
This is how ARP spoofing or ARP poisoning works ‚Äî used in LAN-based hacking.


---

## Can we Prevent ARP Attacks?

***Sort of.***

> **Use static ARP entries (manually set IP-MAC mappings)**

> **Use port security and VLANs**

> **Use tools like ARPwatch to monitor weird changes**

> **Use HTTPS (so even if someone spoofs, they can't decrypt)**

# Summary

**‚Ä¢ ARP is used in LAN to resolve IP ‚Üí MAC**

**‚Ä¢ It works only inside local networks (not across the internet)**

**‚Ä¢ Every device keeps an ARP table**

**‚Ä¢ It can be abused (ARP spoofing)**

**‚Ä¢ It‚Äôs like asking: ‚ÄúWho has this IP address? Give me your MAC!‚Äù**
