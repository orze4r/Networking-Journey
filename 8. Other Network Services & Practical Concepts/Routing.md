# Routing — How data knows where to go

## What is Routing?

Imagine sending a letter to someone in another city.

 I don’t give it *directly* to the person — I give it to the **post office**, they check the address, pass it along to the right **city**, then the right **area**, then the **house**.

**That’s what routers do.**  
They guide my internet data ("packets") from my device to the destination (like Google, YouTube, etc).

Routing is literally **“how data finds its way across networks.”**

## The Mission of Routing

> Me: “I want to watch YouTube.”  
> My router: “Cool. Let me find the best path to reach those YouTube servers.”

- My phone/laptop sends packets to my router
- My router forwards it to your ISP (Internet Service Provider)
- ISP routes it through other routers → until it hits the destination
- The response comes back the same way (or sometimes a slightly different way)

## What's Being Routed?

The data I send — called **packets** — has:
- A **source IP** (your device)
- A **destination IP** (e.g., YouTube’s server)

Routers check the destination IP and say:
> "Hmm... this looks like it belongs to the YouTube gang — lemme send it that way."

## Routing Table

Every router has a cheat sheet called a **routing table**.

It looks like this:

| Destination IP Range | Next Hop |
|----------------------|----------|
| 192.168.0.0/16       | Local    |
| 0.0.0.0/0            | ISP      |

It helps decide where each packet should go next.

## Static vs Dynamic Routing

- **Static Routing** = manually configured
  - Good for small setups
  - Doesn’t adapt automatically
- **Dynamic Routing** = routers talk to each other to find the best path
  - Uses protocols like RIP, OSPF, BGP
  - Great for big networks or the internet

## Default Gateway

My router is my **default gateway**.

When my device doesn’t know where to send something — it dumps it on the router like:
> “Here bro, you deal with this.”

The router then handles the rest.

---

## Reverse Routing?

Yep. Routing is two-way. If I request YouTube.com, the server needs to know how to route the **reply** back to me.

So it’s a whole back-and-forth mail system going on in milliseconds.

---

## Summary: Routing in plain speak

- Routing is just **how data finds its way from A to B**
- Routers use **routing tables** to decide next steps
- Packets carry my data and IP info
- My home router is your **traffic cop + dispatcher**
- Dynamic routing makes the internet run smoothly
