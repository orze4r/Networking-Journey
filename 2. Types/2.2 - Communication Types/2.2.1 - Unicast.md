## What is Unicast?

**Unicast = One-to-One communication**  
Just like it sounds — data goes from one sender to one receiver. Only the target device gets the message. Think of it like sending a private message on WhatsApp — only the person you chose sees it.

---

## Where do we see Unicast?

- Browsing websites (your device ↔ server)  
- Sending emails (sender ↔ recipient mail server)  
- File transfers via FTP between two computers  
- Streaming a private video from your PC to a friend’s PC

---

## Why it’s useful?

- Direct and efficient for one-to-one communication  
- Only the intended recipient receives the data (a little privacy bonus)  
- Works for most Internet traffic — literally everywhere

---

## Any downsides?

- If we want to send the same data to multiple devices, we need **separate streams** for each — not efficient  
- Not ideal for “group broadcasts” like LAN game invites or IPTV streams

## Quick visual 

```mermaid

    A[Sender] --> B[Receiver]
```
Only the receiver B gets the data, nobody else on the network sees it



---

## Overall

- Unicast = private one-to-one communication
- Everywhere on the Internet
- Simple, direct, and efficient — but not for sending stuff to many at once
