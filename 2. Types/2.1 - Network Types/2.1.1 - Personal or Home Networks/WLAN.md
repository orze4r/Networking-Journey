## What‚Äôs WLAN?

**WLAN = Wireless Local Area Network**

Basically, a LAN but with **no wires** ‚Äî it runs on **Wi-Fi**. That‚Äôs literally it.  
LAN = Ethernet cables and switches.  
WLAN = Wi-Fi and signal drops.

## What makes it ‚Äúwireless‚Äù?

- Uses **[radio waves](https://github.com/bwbearr/Field-Notes/blob/1ceebe59d9b678e535e6594db8aaf2f8e707d605/Networking/4.%20Transmission%20Media/4.2%20-%20Wireless/4.2.1%20-%20Radio.md)** instead of cables
- Devices connect via **Wi-Fi routers or Access Points**
- Same IP stuff, same [DHCP](https://github.com/bwbearr/Field-Notes/blob/1ceebe59d9b678e535e6594db8aaf2f8e707d605/Networking/8.%20Other%20Network%20Services%20%26%20Practical%20Concepts/DHCP.md) assigning ‚Äî but all happens in the air (sometimes with ghosts interfering)

## Devices in a WLAN

- Our phone
- Our laptop
- That dusty old tablet
- Smart fridge (well‚Ä¶ it's wierd)
- Anything with a Wi-Fi chip

These devices connect to the same network ‚Äî but wirelessly. No [RJ45](https://github.com/bwbearr/Field-Notes/blob/main/Networking/4.%20Transmission%20Media/4.1%20-%20Wired/4.1.1%20-%20Ethernet.md#rj45--the-plug-that-rules-all) plugging drama.

## Real-World Setup

- Router sends Wi-Fi signal around our house
- Devices connect to SSID (network name)
- Router assigns IPs (usually private ones like 192.168.x.x)
- We stream YouTube, download memes, and complain about lag ‚Äî all over WLAN

## Weaknesses (Let's be honest, bro)

| Problem | Why it Sucks |
|--------|--------------|
| Signal drops | Walls, micro-waves, and ghosts interfere |
| Slower than LAN | Wireless overhead and congestion |
| Less secure | People can sniff Wi-Fi packets |
| Bandwidth split | Everyone eats from the same pie |

---

## Is WLAN secure?

Depends on how we set it up.

- Use **WPA3 or at least WPA2**
- Disable **WPS** (Wi-Fi Protected Setup = clown mode)
- Change default passwords
- Separate guest networks

Still, someone parked outside our house can try funny stuff if we‚Äôre not careful.

## Summary

- WLAN = LAN with Wi-Fi
- Great for convenience, bad for stability
- Used in homes, caf√©s, airports, campuses
- Easy to use, easy to mess up security
- Know your router settings, or suffer
