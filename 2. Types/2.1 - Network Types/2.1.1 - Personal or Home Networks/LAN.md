## What the heck is LAN now?

**LAN = Local Area Network**  
Just like it sounds ‚Äî it's a network that exists locally. Inside our house, room, caf√©, office, etc. Small and limited.

Devices like our phone, our laptop, our annoying smart TV, and maybe that Alexa speaker we never use ‚Äî they all connect together over Wi-Fi or Ethernet inside a LAN.

## Where we find LANs?

- In our home (router connects phone + laptop + TV)
- In our school‚Äôs computer lab
- In offices with shared printers and computers
- Gaming caf√©s (yes, those still exist somewhere)

---

##  Common things people do in a LAN

- Share files across PCs  
- Play LAN games (yes, real nerds still do that ‚Äî Halo, CS 1.6 style)
- Print from any device on a shared printer
- Use one internet connection across multiple devices

## How devices connect?

- **Wired LAN:** [Ethernet cables](https://github.com/orze4r/Networking-Journey/blob/main/4.%20Transmission%20Media/4.1%20-%20Wired/4.1.1%20-%20Ethernet.md) + [switch](https://github.com/orze4r/Networking-Journey/blob/main/3.%20Network%20Hardware%20%26%20Topologies/3.1%20-%20Devices/3.1.3%20-%20Switch.md)/[router](https://github.com/orze4r/Networking-Journey/blob/main/3.%20Network%20Hardware%20%26%20Topologies/3.1%20-%20Devices/3.1.5%20-%20Router.md)
- **Wireless LAN:** Wi-Fi (the one we're probably using right now)
- **Hybrid:** Some wired, some wireless

## What makes LAN special?

| Feature | Why it Matters |
|--------|----------------|
| Limited Range | Usually inside a building or floor |
| High Speed | Faster than WAN because it's local |
| Low Latency | No ISP bottlenecks (unless you're watching Netflix on every device) |
| Easy Sharing | Devices discover each other easily |
| Private | Not exposed to the public internet unless routed |

## Is LAN secure?

LAN itself is private ‚Äî but that doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs ‚Äúsecure.‚Äù  
Anyone connected can scan or sniff things unless our network has:

- Good router settings
- Proper device permissions
- Firewalls or MAC filtering

Don‚Äôt trust ‚ÄúGuests‚Äù ‚Äî even on your home network

---

## Overall

- LAN is our **local private** network.
- Fast, close-range, and made for internal device comms.
- Routers, switches, and [access points](https://github.com/orze4r/Networking-Journey/blob/main/3.%20Network%20Hardware%20%26%20Topologies/3.1%20-%20Devices/3.1.7%20-%20Access%20Point.md) usually manage it.
- Not exposed to the whole world‚Ä¶ unless misconfigured.
