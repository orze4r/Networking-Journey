## üè† What is HAN?

**HAN = Home Area Network**  
It‚Äôs basically the tiny version of a [LAN](https://github.com/bwbearr/Field-Notes/blob/2cc1ab190754b922cb81c6c34e275ff878dcee76/Networking/2.%20Types/2.1%20-%20Network%20Types/2.1.1%20-%20Personal%20or%20Home%20Networks/LAN.md), designed specifically for our home setup.

Think: all our home gadgets connected to our [router](https://github.com/bwbearr/Field-Notes/blob/2cc1ab190754b922cb81c6c34e275ff878dcee76/Networking/3.%20Network%20Hardware%20%26%20Topologies/3.1%20-%20Devices/3.1.5%20-%20Router.md) ‚Äî our phone, TV, laptop, tablet, smart fridge, even that ‚Äúsmart‚Äù bulb that barely works.

## Why do we care?

Because almost everyone has a HAN ‚Äî and they don‚Äôt even realize it.  
Our [Wi-Fi](https://github.com/bwbearr/Field-Notes/blob/2cc1ab190754b922cb81c6c34e275ff878dcee76/Networking/4.%20Transmission%20Media/4.2%20-%20Wireless/4.2.3%20-%20WiFi.md) router connects every device in our house into a **private local network**, making them a part of our **Home Area Network**.

It‚Äôs like a digital family dinner, where my devices silently talk to each other ‚Äî sharing files, streaming shows, and sometimes leaking our data if not secured.

## What devices are in a HAN?

- Router (the boss)
- Laptop
- Smartphone
- Tablet
- Smart TV
- IoT devices (bulbs, cameras, doorbells)
- Printers
- Consoles (PlayStation, Xbox, etc.)

## Security Considerations

| Issue             | Why it matters                                        |
|------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| Weak passwords    | Easily guessable = easy target                        |
| No device isolation | Any compromised device can talk to others             |
| IoT junk          | Half the devices never get updates = vulnerability soup |
| Guests on network | Can scan other devices unless segmented               |

A HAN may be tiny, but it's still vulnerable if we're careless.

## Overall

- HAN is basically **LAN at home**
- All devices are part of the same little network
- Needs basic network hygiene (passwords, updates, device isolation)
