## What is PAN?

**PAN = Personal Area Network** 

*(Not the Paan we eat at Mithu Paan Dukan in Banaras)*

---


A PAN is the smallest network possible ‚Äî it‚Äôs literally *our own* private digital bubble. Think of it like the tech version of our deodorant range: only our devices are supposed to live in it.

It's used to connect stuff that stays close to us ‚Äî phone, smartwatch, laptop, earbuds, maybe even that sketchy fitness band we bought during lockdown.

## Real-Life examples

- **Our phone connected to our smartwatch**
- **Laptop transferring files to our phone via [Bluetooth](https://github.com/orze4r/Networking-Journey/blob/main/4.%20Transmission%20Media/4.2%20-%20Wireless/4.2.4%20-%20Bluetooth.md)**
- **Wireless keyboard/mouse dongle**
- **Sharing files with ourselves via Hotspot + Wi-Fi Direct**

## What tech creates a PAN?

| Technology | Use |
|------------|-----|
| Bluetooth | Most common for PAN (headphones, wearables, etc.) |
| [IR (Infrared)](https://github.com/orze4r/Networking-Journey/blob/main/4.%20Transmission%20Media/4.2%20-%20Wireless/4.2.5%20-%20Infrared.md) | Grandpa tech ‚Äî almost dead now but used in old remotes, phones |
| NFC | Used for tap-to-pay and small data exchanges |
| Wi-Fi Direct | Like Bluetooth but using Wi-Fi power |
| USB | Yep ‚Äî technically a wired PAN between our phone and laptop |

---

## Range of a PAN?

| Type | Range |
|------|-------|
| Bluetooth | ~10 meters max (mostly 5m useful) |
| NFC | < 10 cm |
| USB | Physical cable = our hand's length lol |
| Wi-Fi Direct | ~100 meters (depends on the device)

---

## Why PAN is cool

- No ISP needed
- Fast for small files or pairing
- Low power consumption (Bluetooth/NFC)
- Secure-ish (in theory‚Ä¶)
- Pronounciates like *Paan‚Ä¶*
---

## Risks?

- **Bluetooth hacks** (BlueSnarfing, BlueBugging)
- **Bad Pairing**: Accepting connections from unknown devices
- **Leaving Wi-Fi Direct or Hotspot always on = not good**

---

## Overall

- PAN is just us and our gadgets chilling in their own zone
- Mostly Bluetooth, NFC, or wired USB
- Used for wearables, quick sharing, and short-range comms
- Not made for scale, just comfort
