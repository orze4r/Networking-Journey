##  What is a VAN?

**VAN = Value-Added Network** *(not a vehicle)*

It sounds like some startup buzzword, but it's real ‚Äî a VAN is a **private network** offered by a third-party provider that adds **extra features or services** on top of basic data transfer.

Used mostly in **business-to-business (B2B)** setups to exchange data securely, especially when dealing with **EDI (Electronic Data Interchange)**.

---

##  Why would anyone use a VAN?

Before the internet got cheap and reliable, companies used VANs to:

- Transmit invoices, orders, shipping notices (EDI documents)
- Handle secure file transfer
- Validate data formats
- Archive messages
- Log access and changes

Even now, some legacy systems and industries (like healthcare, logistics, finance) **still rely** on VANs for B2B data exchange.

## Still alive in 2025?

Yes. A lot of old corporate systems and legacy vendors still use VANs ‚Äî especially where **compliance** and **audit logs** matter more than speed or modernity.

Think: boring paperwork, but with expensive networking and high reliability.

## Overall

- VANs aren‚Äôt for gamers or casual users
- They‚Äôre business pipes with ‚Äúextras‚Äù ‚Äî translation, logging, compliance, etc.
- Kind of like a VIP tunnel for boring but important data
