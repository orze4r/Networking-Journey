## What is Subnetting?

Let’s keep it simple.

Subnetting is:  
> Taking one big-ass network and **chopping** it into smaller networks… so things don’t get messy.

It’s like:
- Dividing my class into smaller groups to avoid chaos.
- Not giving 254 water bottles to 4 people.
- Not shouting to everyone when I just wanted to say "hi" to one.

---

## Why do we even do this?

- Because we **don’t need 254 IPs** for 10 devices.
- Because smaller networks = **less noise, better security, cleaner routing**.
- Because IP addresses are not infinite. IPv4 is stingy af.
- And because it’s just **good management**.

## What I know for sure (not sure)

### 🧩 IP Address
- It’s our device’s name tag on the network.
- Format: `192.168.1.10` (4 numbers, 0–255 range)

### 🧩 [Subnet Mask](https://github.com/orze4r/Networking-Journey/blob/main/5.%20Network%20Addressing%20%26%20Identity/5.1%20-%20IP%20Addressing/5.1.9-2%20%20-%20Subnetting%20Binary.md#whats-a-subnet-mask)
- Tells us: **How much of this IP belongs to the network?** And how much can be used for devices (hosts)?
- Common one: `255.255.255.0` (aka `/24`)

### 🧩 [CIDR](https://github.com/orze4r/Networking-Journey/blob/main/5.%20Network%20Addressing%20%26%20Identity/5.1%20-%20IP%20Addressing/5.1.7%20-%20CIDR%20(Classless%20Addressing).md) Notation
- Just a fancy way of saying how many bits belong to the network.
- Example:  
  `/24` = 24 bits for network → rest for hosts  
  `/25` = 25 bits for network → fewer host IPs

The bigger the number after `/`, the **smaller** the subnet.

## Real examples
| Subnet (CIDR) | Total IPs | Usable IPs | Notes                       |
|---------------|-----------|------------|-----------------------------|
| /24           | 256       | 254        | Classic home Wi-Fi range    |
| /25           | 128       | 126        | Half of /24                 |
| /26           | 64        | 62         | Quarter of /24              |
| /30           | 4         | 2          | Point-to-point connections  |
| /32           | 1         | 1          | For a single device only    |

> 😐 Total IPs = usable IPs + 2 (1 for network, 1 for broadcast)

## Analogy time (funny lmao)

Imagine you’re bathing.  
You need **2 buckets of water**.  
Subnetting makes sure **you get 2**, not **256**.  
[IPv4](https://github.com/orze4r/Networking-Journey/blob/main/5.%20Network%20Addressing%20%26%20Identity/5.1%20-%20IP%20Addressing/5.1.1%20-%20IPv4%20Address.md) is running out. Stop wasting buckets.

---

## How it helps:

- Limits chaos (broadcasts stay within the subnet)
- Easier to isolate problems (smaller zones = faster detection)
- Better for routing and firewall rules
- Saves IPs for other people (don’t be greedy)

---

## Realizations

- Subnetting is not about being a network god.
- It’s about **not being an idiot** who throws 1000 IPs at 5 laptops.
- Knowing `/24` means 254 usable is already big brain stuff.
- Still hate binary math. Still pretending I get it.

##  Conclusion

Subnetting isn’t hard. It’s just taught badly.  
You don’t need to be a math wizard — You just need to get the idea:

> Split big networks into small ones, don’t waste IPs, keep things neat.

That’s it. Don’t let anyone make it sound more complicated than that.
