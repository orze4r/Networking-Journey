## Why do we need binary? 😭 

Because IPs are just 32-bit binary numbers wearing makeup (aka dots and decimal).

If we want to subnet or figure out how many hosts we get, we gotta think like the computer. And it doesn’t speak decimal — it speaks in **binary** (1s and 0s).

## How an IP looks in binary

Let’s take `192.168.1.1`

Convert each section to binary:

192 = 11000000
168 = 10101000
1   = 00000001
1   = 00000001

So full IP =  
**`11000000.10101000.00000001.00000001`**

Total = 32 bits. Period. Nothing more.

## What’s a Subnet mask?

It’s a mask made of 1s (for network) and 0s (for host).

- `/24` = 255.255.255.0 = **24 bits of 1s**, 8 bits of 0s  
- `/26` = 255.255.255.192 = **26 bits of 1s**, 6 bits of 0s  

Computer sees this and goes:
> Oh okay, first 26 bits → for network  
> Last 6 bits → for hosts  

---

## Number of Hosts Formula

Hosts = 2^(Number of host bits) - 2

Why `-2`?  
Because:

- 1 IP is for **network address**
- 1 IP is for **broadcast address**

Example:

- `/24` → 8 host bits → 2^8 = 256 → 256 - 2 = **254 usable IPs**
- `/30` → 2 host bits → 2^2 = 4 → 4 - 2 = **2 usable IPs**

## Binary math we should know

| CIDR | Host Bits | Total IPs | Usable IPs |
|------|-----------|-----------|------------|
| /24  | 8         | 256       | 254        |
| /25  | 7         | 128       | 126        |
| /26  | 6         | 64        | 62         |
| /27  | 5         | 32        | 30         |
| /28  | 4         | 16        | 14         |
| /29  | 3         | 8         | 6          |
| /30  | 2         | 4         | 2          |
| /31  | 1         | 2         | 0 or 2 (weird one)
| /32  | 0         | 1         | 1 (just one device)

## Binary trick for Subnet masks

Just remember powers of 2 backward:

| Host Bits | Subnet Bits | Subnet Mask Decimal | Usable IPs |
|-----------|-------------|---------------------|------------|
| 1         | 7           | 128                 | 126        |
| 2         | 6           | 192                 | 62         |
| 3         | 5           | 224                 | 30         |
| 4         | 4           | 240                 | 14         |
| 5         | 3           | 248                 | 6          |
| 6         | 2           | 252                 | 2          |
| 7         | 1           | 254                 | 0 (weird use case)

## Conclusion:

- IPs are binary
- Subnet mask = "how many bits are locked for the network"
- The rest is host space
- Use **2^n - 2** to get usable hosts
- Subnetting without binary = pretending you know networking

## Bonus:

Well, converting `192.168.1.1` to binary gives me this:

`11000000.10101000.00000001.00000001`

Cool. Nice. Nerdy. But...  
**That tells us NOTHING about the network and host parts.**  
It’s just the IP in binary. Doesn’t mean jack unless we know what the **mask** is.

 here’s how it works:

If it’s `192.168.1.1/24`, that `/24` is our real homie.  
It means the subnet mask is:  255.255.255.0, that means
`11111111.11111111.11111111.00000000`  in binary.
→ 24 bits for network   
→ 8 bits left for host devices

Moral of the story?  
Don’t try to count 1s in the IP and pretend you’re doing subnetting.  
**Always check the CIDR** — final boss here.
