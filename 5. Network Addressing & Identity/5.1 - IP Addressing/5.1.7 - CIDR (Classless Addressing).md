## What is CIDR?

CIDR is like giving network admins a scalpel instead of a hammer.  
Instead of rigid IP [classes](https://github.com/orze4r/Networking-Journey/blob/main/5.%20Network%20Addressing%20%26%20Identity/5.1%20-%20IP%20Addressing/5.1.2%20-%20IP%20Classes.md) (Class A, B, C), CIDR lets us **slice networks** to fit exactly what we need.

**CIDR Notation:**  
Looks like this ‚Üí `192.168.1.0/24`  
It means:  
- IP address: `192.168.1.0`  
- `/24` ‚Üí The **first 24 bits** are the **network portion**  
- The remaining **8 bits** are for **host addresses**  

---

## Why not the class system?

### In classful IP (the older method):

| Class | Starting Bits | Range               | Host IPs Available |
|-------|----------------|---------------------|---------------------|
| A     | 0xxxxxxx       | 0.0.0.0 ‚Äì 127.255.255.255 | ~16 million |
| B     | 10xxxxxx       | 128.0.0.0 ‚Äì 191.255.255.255 | ~65,000     |
| C     | 110xxxxx       | 192.0.0.0 ‚Äì 223.255.255.255 | 254         |

The issue?  
‚Üí Even if we needed just **300 IPs**, we'd be stuck using **Class B** (65k addresses!)  
‚Üí That‚Äôs like **booking a stadium to host 10 people**.

**Wasted AF.**

## CIDR to the Rescue

With CIDR, instead of 3 fixed blocks (A/B/C), we can now define **networks of any size**.

### Examples:
| CIDR Block        | Subnet Mask        | Usable IPs  |
|------------------|-------------------|-------------|
| `/30`            | 255.255.255.252   | 2           |
| `/29`            | 255.255.255.248   | 6           |
| `/28`            | 255.255.255.240   | 14          |
| `/27`            | 255.255.255.224   | 30          |
| `/26`            | 255.255.255.192   | 62          |
| `/25`            | 255.255.255.128   | 126         |
| `/24`            | 255.255.255.0     | 254         |

Notice how it's not locked into Class A/B/C anymore.

## How Does CIDR Work?

An IPv4 address has **32 bits**.  
CIDR tells us how many bits are **for the network**.

- `/24` ‚Üí 24 bits for network, 8 bits for hosts = 2‚Å∏ = 256 total addresses (254 usable)
- `/29` ‚Üí 29 bits for network, 3 for host = 2¬≥ = 8 total (6 usable)

**Rule:**  
Usable IPs = `2‚Åø - 2`  
(1 reserved for **network ID**, 1 for **broadcast**)

---

## Real-World Example

Let‚Äôs say we‚Äôre given this block: `192.168.10.0/28`

- Total IPs = `2^(32-28)` = 16  
- Usable IPs = `16 - 2` = **14 usable IPs**  
- First: `192.168.10.1`  
- Last: `192.168.10.14`  
- Broadcast: `192.168.10.15`  

Perfect for 14 devices in a department.

## Why CIDR Is Important

- Makes **IP allocation efficient**  
- **Delays [IPv4](https://github.com/orze4r/Networking-Journey/blob/main/5.%20Network%20Addressing%20%26%20Identity/5.1%20-%20IP%20Addressing/5.1.1%20-%20IPv4%20Address.md) exhaustion** (huge deal in early 2000s)  
- **Reduces routing table size** ‚Üí ISPs can summarize networks like `192.168.0.0/16` instead of managing 256 `/24`s

## CIDR vs Subnet Mask?

They're the **same idea**, just in different formats:

| CIDR | Subnet Mask        |
|------|---------------------|
| /8   | 255.0.0.0           |
| /16  | 255.255.0.0         |
| /24  | 255.255.255.0       |
| /30  | 255.255.255.252     |

---

## Quick CIDR Table (Common Ones)

| CIDR | Hosts Usable | Subnet Mask        |
|------|--------------|--------------------|
| /32  | 1            | 255.255.255.255    |
| /30  | 2            | 255.255.255.252    |
| /29  | 6            | 255.255.255.248    |
| /28  | 14           | 255.255.255.240    |
| /27  | 30           | 255.255.255.224    |
| /26  | 62           | 255.255.255.192    |
| /25  | 126          | 255.255.255.128    |
| /24  | 254          | 255.255.255.0      |

## Summary

CIDR = flexible way of dividing IPs.  
Much smarter than the old classful stuff.  
Gives me exactly the number of IPs I need.  
Reduces waste.  
Saves time.  
Saves space.  
Saves sanity.
