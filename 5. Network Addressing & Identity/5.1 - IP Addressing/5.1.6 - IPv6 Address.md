## What is IPv6?

IPv6 is the new version of IP addressing. The older one ‚Äî [**IPv4**](https://github.com/bwbearr/Field-Notes/blob/979bb2bf00e55cd8df03f7033fff7ff3f0ccbbe9/Networking/5.%20Network%20Addressing%20%26%20Identity/5.1%20-%20IP%20Addressing/5.1.1%20-%20IPv4%20Address.md) ‚Äî is running out of addresses.

IPv6 solves that by throwing us into a world of **128-bit** addresses instead of 32-bit.

##  IPv4 vs IPv6

| Feature       | IPv4                | IPv6                                   |
|---------------|---------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Address Length | 32-bit              | 128-bit                                |
| Looks Like     | `192.168.0.1`       | `2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334` |
| Addresses Total | ~4.3 billion        | 340 undecillion (no joke)              |
| Header         | Simple              | More complex                           |
| NAT Required?  | Usually, yes        | No need for NAT                        |

## Why IPv6 even exists?

IPv4 is kinda exhausted.  
Too many devices, not enough addresses.

So IPv6 was created to:
- End the IP address shortage
- Get rid of [NAT](https://github.com/bwbearr/Field-Notes/blob/979bb2bf00e55cd8df03f7033fff7ff3f0ccbbe9/Networking/5.%20Network%20Addressing%20%26%20Identity/5.1%20-%20IP%20Addressing/5.1.8%20-%20NAT%20%26%20CGNAT.md) (mostly)
- Improve [routing](https://github.com/bwbearr/Field-Notes/blob/9277e68534beff80a5859b4c3f498588b3b98f5b/Networking/8.%20Other%20Network%20Services%20%26%20Practical%20Concepts/Routing.md) efficiency
- Simplify network config (with SLAAC etc.)

## How IPv6 Address Looks

Example:

2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334

We‚Äôll see **8 groups**, separated by colons.  
Each group is **16 bits**, written in **hexadecimal** (base-16).

That‚Äôs a total of:  
`8 groups √ó 16 bits = 128 bits`

---

## Shortening the Monster

IPv6 lets you compress:

- Leading zeroes:  
  `03f0` ‚Üí `3f0`

- Consecutive zero blocks:  
  `0000:0000:0000` ‚Üí `::`

### Example:

Original:     2001:0db8:0000:0000:0000:ff00:0042:8329
Compressed:   2001:db8::ff00:42:8329

## Types of IPv6 Addresses

| Type             | Starts With     | Purpose                          |
|------------------|-----------------|----------------------------------|
| **Unicast**      | `2000::/3`      | One-to-one communication         |
| **Multicast**    | `ff00::/8`      | One-to-many (like announcements) |
| **Anycast**      | Depends         | One-to-nearest (routing trick)   |
| **Link-local**   | `fe80::/10`     | Used only within local network   |
| **Loopback**     | `::1`           | Like 127.0.0.1 in IPv4           |

---

## SLAAC and DHCPv6

IPv6 can **auto-assign** addresses without needing a [DHCP](https://github.com/bwbearr/Field-Notes/blob/979bb2bf00e55cd8df03f7033fff7ff3f0ccbbe9/Networking/8.%20Other%20Network%20Services%20%26%20Practical%20Concepts/DHCP.md) server, using something called:

> SLAAC = Stateless Address Auto-Configuration

But DHCPv6 also exists if we need tighter control.

---

## Is IPv6 more secure?

- It was designed with **IPSec support built-in**  
- Still depends on config ‚Äî not magic by default  
- NAT being optional means more exposure, so **firewalls matter even more**

---

## Overall

- IPv6 is the future (and kinda already present)
- More addresses than you'll ever count
- Gets rid of NAT (mostly)
- Different format than IPv4, but not scary once you get it
- We‚Äôll see it more and more in real-world networks

 ‚ÄúIPv6 looks scary until we realize it‚Äôs just a long-ass hex version of IPv4 with better options.‚Äù
