##  What is an IP Address?

IP = Internet Protocol  
Address = Where something lives on a network

So basically, it‚Äôs **how one device finds another**.  
Like: "Hey `192.168.1.10,` I‚Äôm `192.168.1.15` ‚Äî let‚Äôs talk."

Without IPs, nothing on the internet would work. Not even this note.

---

## Format of an IPv4 Address

- Looks like: `192.168.1.1`
- 4 numbers (called **octets**), separated by dots
- Each number can be from `0` to `255`
- That‚Äôs because each is 8 bits ‚Üí 2‚Å∏ = 256 values

> Example: `192.168.0.50`  
Each part = 8 bits  
Whole thing = 32 bits (4x8)

## Types of IP Addresses

### üî∏ [Private IPs](https://github.com/bwbearr/Field-Notes/blob/1d395413dc0802cdb4c8534caaf7f8ceaaff0846/Networking/5.%20Network%20Addressing%20%26%20Identity/5.1%20-%20IP%20Addressing/5.1.3%20-%20Private%20vs%20Public%20IP.md)
- Used inside our home/school/company network
- Not visible to the public internet
- Common ranges:
  - `10.0.0.0 ‚Äì 10.255.255.255`
  - `172.16.0.0 ‚Äì 172.31.255.255`
  - `192.168.0.0 ‚Äì 192.168.255.255`

> Example: Our phone on Wi-Fi gets `192.168.1.5`

### üîπ [Public IPs](https://github.com/bwbearr/Field-Notes/blob/1d395413dc0802cdb4c8534caaf7f8ceaaff0846/Networking/5.%20Network%20Addressing%20%26%20Identity/5.1%20-%20IP%20Addressing/5.1.3%20-%20Private%20vs%20Public%20IP.md)
- Given by our ISP
- Visible to the outside world
- What sites like `ifconfig.me` show us
- Often shared via [CGNAT](https://github.com/bwbearr/Field-Notes/blob/1d395413dc0802cdb4c8534caaf7f8ceaaff0846/Networking/5.%20Network%20Addressing%20%26%20Identity/5.1%20-%20IP%20Addressing/5.1.8%20-%20NAT%20%26%20CGNAT.md) on mobile

> Example: Our mobile data IP like `103.21.250.58`

---

## Loopback & Special ones

- `127.0.0.1` ‚Üí [**Loopback (localhost)**](https://github.com/bwbearr/Field-Notes/blob/1d395413dc0802cdb4c8534caaf7f8ceaaff0846/Networking/5.%20Network%20Addressing%20%26%20Identity/5.1%20-%20IP%20Addressing/5.1.4%20-%20Loopback%20IP.md)  
  Your device talking to itself.  
  Good for testing.

- `0.0.0.0` ‚Üí **Means ‚Äúall IPs‚Äù / unspecified**  
  Often used in configs to say ‚Äúlisten on all interfaces.‚Äù

- `255.255.255.255` ‚Üí **Broadcast address**  
  Sends a message to everyone in the network.

---

## Invalid IP Stuff

- No IP octet can go beyond 255
- `x.x.x.256` is **bullshit**. Don‚Äôt fall for it.

---

## üìçStatic vs Dynamic IPs

| Type   | What it Means                     |
|--------|----------------------------------|
| Static | IP never changes. Manually set.  |
| Dynamic | IP changes every time (via DHCP) |

Home [routers](https://github.com/bwbearr/Field-Notes/blob/1d395413dc0802cdb4c8534caaf7f8ceaaff0846/Networking/3.%20Network%20Hardware%20%26%20Topologies/3.1%20-%20Devices/3.1.5%20-%20Router.md) usually assign **dynamic private IPs** to your devices.  
ISPs give you dynamic public IPs too (unless you pay for static).

---

## üß© How it all connects

- We connect to a router ‚Üí we get a **private IP**
- Router talks to the internet using **its public IP**
- [NAT](https://github.com/bwbearr/Field-Notes/blob/1d395413dc0802cdb4c8534caaf7f8ceaaff0846/Networking/7.%20Protocols/7.3%20-%20Network%20Layer%20Protocols/NAT-PAT-CGNAT.md) maps our private IP to the public one
- Everything else runs on this logic.

---

## IPs and Security

- IPs can be traced (roughly)
- Some sites block certain IP ranges
- [VPNs](https://github.com/bwbearr/Field-Notes/blob/1d395413dc0802cdb4c8534caaf7f8ceaaff0846/Networking/9.%20Security%20Concepts/VPN.md) and [Proxies](https://github.com/bwbearr/Field-Notes/blob/1d395413dc0802cdb4c8534caaf7f8ceaaff0846/Networking/9.%20Security%20Concepts/Proxy.md) = tools to change or hide public IP
- Tools like `whois` can tell who owns an IP block

---


## Summary

IP = **identity on a network**  
No IP = no talk = no internet

 Gotta understand:
- What an IP looks like
- Which ones are private vs public
- How devices use them
- And how you can test them with tools
