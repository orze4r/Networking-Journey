# APIPA (Automatic Private IP Addressing)

When our system can’t contact a **[DHCP](https://github.com/bwbearr/Field-Notes/blob/874fb34371b1691507b4546fd30a04c03c6575f1/Networking/8.%20Other%20Network%20Services%20%26%20Practical%20Concepts/DHCP.md) server**, it doesn't just give up — it assigns itself an IP in a special range called **APIPA**.

---

## What is APIPA?

> APIPA stands for **Automatic Private IP Addressing**.  
> It’s a fallback IP range used by devices when they **fail to get an IP** from DHCP.

So instead of going blank, our system gives itself an address like:

169.254.x.x

👀 Ever seen this on Windows? Now we know what it is.

## Range

- **169.254.0.1 to 169.254.255.254**
- Reserved by **IANA** for local-link communication
- Cannot be routed outside the local network

---

## When does it happen?

- When our device is set to get **IP automatically**
- But it can’t reach the **DHCP server** — that’s the thing that normally gives out IP addresses (usually our router).
- So it defaults to APIPA and gives itself an **emergency address** or to at least try **[LAN](https://github.com/bwbearr/Field-Notes/blob/874fb34371b1691507b4546fd30a04c03c6575f1/Networking/2.%20Types/2.1%20-%20Network%20Types/2.1.1%20-%20Personal%20or%20Home%20Networks/LAN.md) communication**
---

## Example

1. We plug our [Ethernet](https://github.com/bwbearr/Field-Notes/blob/874fb34371b1691507b4546fd30a04c03c6575f1/Networking/4.%20Transmission%20Media/4.1%20-%20Wired/4.1.1%20-%20Ethernet.md) in.
2. DHCP server is off (in most Home networks — the router itself is the DHCP server.)
3. Your system:  
   “Okay then. I’ll just use 169.254.x.x and try to survive.”

We can **still connect to other devices** on the same network using APIPA — **if** they also have a 169.254 address.

---

## Limitations

- No internet access
- Can’t communicate with routers
- Only useful within that APIPA range (169.254.x.x)

---

## Commands to check (Windows/Linux)

**Windows:**
```bash
ipconfig
```
**Linux:**
```bash
ip a
```
If we see a 169.254 IP, our system’s in APIPA mode.

## Why it matters?

- Helps in troubleshooting DHCP issues
- Explains why we “have an IP” but no internet
- Not an error — just a fallback!

> 💡 Tip: If you're stuck with a 169.254 address,
 try restarting your router or checking DHCP settings.
