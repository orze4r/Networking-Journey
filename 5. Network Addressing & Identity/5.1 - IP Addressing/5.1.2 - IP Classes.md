Before [**CIDR**](https://github.com/bwbearr/Field-Notes/blob/d4d4be5c40602d487cd7197004c5987885eb5fe7/Networking/5.%20Network%20Addressing%20%26%20Identity/5.1%20-%20IP%20Addressing/5.1.7%20-%20CIDR%20(Classless%20Addressing).md) and modern [subnetting](https://github.com/bwbearr/Field-Notes/blob/d4d4be5c40602d487cd7197004c5987885eb5fe7/Networking/5.%20Network%20Addressing%20%26%20Identity/5.1%20-%20IP%20Addressing/5.1.9%20-%20Subnetting.md) came into play, IP addresses were divided into **5 classes** (A to E) — based on how big or small a network was. This was called the **Classful Addressing system**.

Today, this system is **outdated**, but it’s still asked in interviews and foundational exams.

## What are IP Classes?

In IPv4, the address space was split into ranges called **classes**:

- Class A → Big companies / ISPs  
- Class B → Universities / Medium orgs  
- Class C → Home networks / Small biz  
- Class D → Multicast  
- Class E → Reserved (Do not use)

---

## Class A

- **Range**: `1.0.0.0` → `126.255.255.255`
- **Default Subnet Mask**: `255.0.0.0` → `/8`
- **Hosts Possible**: ~16 million per network
- **Usage**: Very large networks like Google, ISP backbones
- **Network Bits**: `8`, Host Bits: `24`
- **First Bit in Binary**: Always starts with `0`
- **Example IP**: `10.0.0.1`

*Only `0.x.x.x` and `127.x.x.x` are excluded (0 is reserved, 127 is loopback).*

---

## Class B

- **Range**: `128.0.0.0` → `191.255.255.255`
- **Default Subnet Mask**: `255.255.0.0` → `/16`
- **Hosts Possible**: ~65,000 per network
- **Usage**: Medium-sized networks like universities or companies
- **Network Bits**: `16`, Host Bits: `16`
- **First 2 Bits**: Always `10`
- **Example IP**: `172.16.0.1`

---

## Class C

- **Range**: `192.0.0.0` → `223.255.255.255`
- **Default Subnet Mask**: `255.255.255.0` → `/24`
- **Hosts Possible**: 254 per network
- **Usage**: Home networks, offices, small orgs
- **Network Bits**: `24`, Host Bits: `8`
- **First 3 Bits**: Always `110`
- **Example IP**: `192.168.1.1`

---

## Class D – Multicast

- **Range**: `224.0.0.0` → `239.255.255.255`
- **Used for**: Multicast (one-to-many transmission)
- **No subnet mask**
- **Example**: Used in streaming, IPTV, routing protocols

---

## Class E – Reserved

- **Range**: `240.0.0.0` → `255.255.255.255`
- **Usage**: Experimental / Reserved for future use
- **Should not be used in real-world networking**

## Quick Summary Table

| Class | Range              | Subnet Mask       | Usage               | Hosts/Network |
|-------|--------------------|-------------------|----------------------|---------------|
| A     | 1.0.0.0 – 126.x.x.x| 255.0.0.0 (/8)    | Large Orgs / ISPs   | ~16 million   |
| B     | 128.0.0.0 – 191.x.x.x | 255.255.0.0 (/16)| Universities / Medium Orgs | ~65,000   |
| C     | 192.0.0.0 – 223.x.x.x | 255.255.255.0 (/24)| Home/Small Business | 254       |
| D     | 224.0.0.0 – 239.x.x.x | No mask           | Multicasting         | —             |
| E     | 240.0.0.0 – 255.x.x.x | No mask           | Reserved / Experimental | —         |

## But wait… Why is this outdated?

Because we now use:

- [**CIDR**](https://github.com/bwbearr/Field-Notes/blob/d4d4be5c40602d487cd7197004c5987885eb5fe7/Networking/5.%20Network%20Addressing%20%26%20Identity/5.1%20-%20IP%20Addressing/5.1.7%20-%20CIDR%20(Classless%20Addressing).md) → Classless Inter-Domain Routing
- **VLSM** → Variable Length Subnet Masking  
These allow more flexible and efficient IP usage.

🚀 *Still, this helps in understanding the roots of IP addressing.*
