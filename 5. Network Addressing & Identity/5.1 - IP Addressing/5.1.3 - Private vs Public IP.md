When our device connects to a network, it needs an IP address. But not all IPs are treated equally ‚Äî some are **private**, used only inside homes and offices, while others are **public**, used to connect to the real internet.

Let‚Äôs break it down clearly:

## What is a Private IP?

Private IPs are **meant for internal communication** ‚Äî inside our house, office, school, etc.

Our device (like phone/laptop) gets a private IP from our [**router**](https://github.com/bwbearr/Field-Notes/blob/50f49eb36f1d1ec6e42661c269622d4a4b503283/Networking/3.%20Network%20Hardware%20%26%20Topologies/3.1%20-%20Devices/3.1.5%20-%20Router.md), usually through [**DHCP**.](https://github.com/bwbearr/Field-Notes/blob/50f49eb36f1d1ec6e42661c269622d4a4b503283/Networking/8.%20Other%20Network%20Services%20%26%20Practical%20Concepts/DHCP.md)  
These IPs **cannot be used to access the internet directly** ‚Äî instead, our router handles that using [**NAT**](https://github.com/bwbearr/Field-Notes/blob/50f49eb36f1d1ec6e42661c269622d4a4b503283/Networking/5.%20Network%20Addressing%20%26%20Identity/5.1%20-%20IP%20Addressing/5.1.8%20-%20NAT%20%26%20CGNAT.md)

> Think of a private IP like a nickname inside our friend group. Only our group knows it ‚Äî the outside world doesn‚Äôt.

###  Real-life Example:

- Our phone: `192.168.1.5`
- Our PC: `192.168.1.10`

Both are private IPs, can talk to each other inside the same Wi-Fi, but need the **router‚Äôs public IP** to talk to the internet.

### Private IP Ranges (Reserved by IANA)

These IPs are **never routed on the public internet**. They're safe to use in any internal network.

| Range (CIDR)          | Notes                    |
|------------------------|--------------------------|
| `10.0.0.0/8`           | Class A ‚Äì large networks |
| `172.16.0.0/12`        | Class B ‚Äì medium         |
| `192.168.0.0/16`       | Class C ‚Äì most home setups |

> If our IP starts with **10.**, **172.16‚Äì31**, or **192.168.**, it‚Äôs private.

---

## What is a Public IP?

Public IPs are **routable on the internet**. Every device that wants to talk over the internet **must use a public IP** ‚Äî either directly (servers) or indirectly (via NAT).

We don‚Äôt choose this ‚Äî our **ISP assigns our router** a public IP.

> It's like our real-world home address ‚Äî unique, visible, reachable (and needs protection!).

### üß† Example:

Our router: `117.203.24.56` (public IP given by ISP)  
Our phone: `192.168.1.4` (private IP inside Wi-Fi)

Our phone **sends data via router**, which uses this public IP to talk to the internet.

## How to identify Public vs Private IP

Here's how to quickly tell the difference:

### Private IP check:

| Starts With          | Private? | Why                   |
|----------------------|----------|------------------------|
| `10.`                | ‚úÖ Yes   | Reserved by IANA       |
| `192.168.`           | ‚úÖ Yes   | Most home routers use this |
| `172.16.`‚Äì`172.31.`  | ‚úÖ Yes   | Class B reserved        |
| `169.254.`           | [‚ö†Ô∏è APIPA](https://github.com/bwbearr/Field-Notes/blob/50f49eb36f1d1ec6e42661c269622d4a4b503283/Networking/5.%20Network%20Addressing%20%26%20Identity/5.1%20-%20IP%20Addressing/5.1.5%20-%20APIPA.md) | Self-assigned, not usable outside LAN |
| Any other IP         | ‚ùå Likely Public | Reachable from internet |

> We can use `ipconfig` (Windows) or `ip a` (Linux) to see our local IP  
> We can also use [whatismyip.com](https://whatismyip.com) to see our public IP

## Summary Table

| Feature                 | Private IP                     | Public IP                    |
|-------------------------|--------------------------------|------------------------------|
| Visible on internet?    | ‚ùå No                          | ‚úÖ Yes                       |
| Assigned by             | Router/DHCP                   | ISP                          |
| Globally unique?        | ‚ùå No (same in many networks)  | ‚úÖ Yes                       |
| Secure by default?      | ‚úÖ Not directly exposed        | ‚ùå Needs firewall/config     |
| Used for                | LAN communication             | Internet communication       |
| Examples                | 192.168.0.1, 10.0.0.4          | 122.175.44.12, 8.8.8.8       |

## üöÄ Bonus: Why not use public IPs for every device?

- It‚Äôs unsafe! Every device exposed to the internet is a target.
- It‚Äôs expensive! Public [IPv4](https://github.com/bwbearr/Field-Notes/blob/7c8f4d7a7275cc20370414e855835d1936ef05c0/Networking/5.%20Network%20Addressing%20%26%20Identity/5.1%20-%20IP%20Addressing/5.1.1%20-%20IPv4%20Address.md) addresses are limited and cost money.
- That‚Äôs why most homes use **one public IP** and let the router handle the rest via [**NAT**](https://github.com/bwbearr/Field-Notes/blob/7c8f4d7a7275cc20370414e855835d1936ef05c0/Networking/5.%20Network%20Addressing%20%26%20Identity/5.1%20-%20IP%20Addressing/5.1.8%20-%20NAT%20%26%20CGNAT.md)
