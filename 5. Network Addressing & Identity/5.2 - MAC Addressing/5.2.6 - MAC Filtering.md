# 🔐 MAC Filtering

---

## 🔹 What is MAC Filtering?
- A network security feature that **allows or blocks devices** based on their **MAC addresses**.  
- Works at the **Access Point (AP) / Router / Switch** level.  
- Example: Only devices with approved MACs can connect to Wi-Fi.  

---

## 🔹 How it Works
1. Network device maintains a **list of allowed or denied MAC addresses**.  
2. When a device tries to connect:
   - If **allowed** → connection succeeds.  
   - If **denied** → connection is blocked.  

---

## 🔹 Types of Filtering
- **Whitelist (Allow List)** → Only specified MACs can connect.  
- **Blacklist (Deny List)** → All devices allowed, except the blocked ones.  

---

## 🔹 Advantages
- Easy to configure on home routers.  
- Adds **basic layer of control** for small networks.  
- Useful for parental control or restricting guest devices.  

---

## 🔹 Weaknesses
1. **MAC Spoofing**  
   - Attackers can change their MAC to a whitelisted one.  
   - Completely bypasses filtering.  

2. **Management Overhead**  
   - Hard to maintain in large networks.  
   - Every new device needs manual approval.  

3. **Not True Security**  
   - Works only at Layer 2.  
   - Provides **no encryption or authentication**.  

---

## 🔹 Real-World Use Cases
- **Home Wi-Fi** → Prevent neighbors from connecting.  
- **Offices / Schools** → Control which devices can access Wi-Fi.  
- **IoT Devices** → Allow only specific smart devices to connect.  

---

## 🔹 Best Practices
- Do **not rely solely** on MAC filtering.  
- Combine with stronger methods:
  - WPA2/WPA3 encryption.  
  - 802.1X authentication.  
  - Network monitoring for spoofed MACs.

## 📌 Quick Recap
| Feature           | Benefit                          | Weakness                   |
|-------------------|----------------------------------|-----------------------------|
| Whitelist         | Only trusted devices allowed     | Can be spoofed easily       |
| Blacklist         | Blocks specific devices          | Limited effectiveness       |
| Overall Security  | Adds control but not true defense| Should be combined with WPA |
