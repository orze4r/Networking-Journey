# ðŸŽ­ MAC Spoofing & Security

---

## ðŸ”¹ What is MAC Spoofing?
- **Changing the original MAC address** of a device to another value.
- Can be done temporarily (software-based) or permanently (firmware/hardware mods).
- Commonly used to **hide identity** or **impersonate another device**.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Why Spoof a MAC Address?
- **Privacy** â†’ Prevents tracking across Wi-Fi hotspots.
- **Testing** â†’ Security assessments, penetration testing.
- **Bypass Restrictions**:
  - Captive portals that whitelist MACs.
  - Networks with MAC-based filtering.
- **Impersonation** â†’ Pretend to be another device on the network.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Security Concerns
- **Bypassing Access Control** â†’ If a network uses MAC whitelisting, spoofing can break it.
- **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks** â†’ Attacker spoofs MAC of a trusted device to intercept traffic.
- **Network Confusion** â†’ Duplicate MACs cause packet delivery issues.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Defensive Measures
1. **Port Security (Switch Level)**
   - Restrict number of MACs allowed per port.
   - Bind a specific MAC to a port (sticky MAC).
   - Shut down port if spoofing is detected.

2. **802.1X Authentication**
   - Device + user authentication before granting access.
   - More secure than MAC filtering.

3. **Monitoring Tools**
   - IDS/IPS systems can detect duplicate or suspicious MAC usage.
   - Example: ARP inspection to catch spoofed entries.

4. **MAC Randomization Awareness**
   - Modern OS (Windows, Linux, Android, iOS) use **MAC randomization** by default in Wi-Fi scanning.
   - Helps protect users but can confuse admins if not accounted for.

## ðŸ“Œ Quick Recap

| Aspect        | Spoofing Impact                         | Defense Strategy         |
|---------------|------------------------------------------|--------------------------|
| Privacy       | Avoids tracking in public networks       | Legitimate use           |
| Bypass        | Defeats MAC-based restrictions           | Use 802.1X auth instead  |
| MITM Attack   | Intercept or redirect traffic            | Port security, ARP insp. |
| Randomization | Protects users, may confuse monitoring   | Update admin policies    |
