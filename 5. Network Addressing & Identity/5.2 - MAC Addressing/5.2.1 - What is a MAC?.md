## What the heck is a MAC Address?

A **MAC Address** is like the fingerprint of our device‚Äôs **network interface** ‚Äî the hardware part that connects to Wi-Fi or Ethernet.

It's burned into our device's **Network Interface Card (NIC)**. Every device that connects to a network has one. It‚Äôs supposed to be unique. Like, globally unique.

---

## How does it look?

Usually something like this: `00:1A:2B:3C:4D:5E`

Or sometimes with hyphens or without separators: `00-1A-2B-3C-4D-5E` or `001A2B3C4D5E`

> ‚úÖ It‚Äôs a **48-bit address** (6 bytes) written in **hexadecimal**.
> ‚úÖ First 3 bytes = **vendor** (who made it), last 3 bytes = **unique device ID**.

## What is it used for?

| Purpose                  | Why it Matters                           |
|--------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Device Identification    | Tells your router: "Hey, I‚Äôm this device" |
| Local Network Communication | Devices use MAC to talk within LAN       |
| ARP & IP Linking         | IPs get mapped to MACs inside your LAN   |
| Filtering & Access Control | Routers can block or allow by MAC        |

## Where does it work?

MAC addresses are used only within the **local network (LAN)**.

When we connect to the internet, our **IP Address** is what goes out.  
MAC doesn‚Äôt travel across the internet ‚Äî routers strip it at every hop.

---

## Can it be changed?

Yes ‚Äî with a technique called **MAC spoofing**.  
We can **temporarily change** our MAC address using tools.

It‚Äôs used in:

- Pen-testing / privacy / evading tracking  
- Bypassing MAC filters  
- Device impersonation (‚ö†Ô∏è Illegal use = dumb idea)

---

## Why is it called ‚ÄúMAC‚Äù?

It has NOTHING to do with Apple Macs üòÜ  
**MAC** stands for **Media Access Control**, because it controls how data gets on the media (cables, Wi-Fi, etc).

---

## Overall

- MAC = Hardware address of your NIC (network chip)  
- Used within your local network (LAN only)  
- Looks like `00:11:22:AA:BB:CC`  
- Tied to device vendor + interface  
- We can spoof it, but we also shouldn‚Äôt go full villain
