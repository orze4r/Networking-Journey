# 🏷️ OUI (Organizationally Unique Identifier)

The **OUI** is the **first 24 bits (3 bytes)** of a MAC address.  
It identifies the **vendor/manufacturer** of the device’s network interface card (NIC).

---

## 🔹 Example breakdown

MAC Address: `00:1A:2B:3C:4D:5E`

- **OUI** → `00:1A:2B`
- **Vendor Assigned** → `3C:4D:5E`

---

## 🔹 How OUIs work

- Assigned by the **IEEE Registration Authority**.
- Each vendor gets a **unique OUI block**.
- Within that block, the vendor can assign the remaining 24 bits to devices.

---

## 🔹 Vendor examples

| OUI Prefix | Vendor |
|------------|---------|
| `00:1A:2B` | Cisco Systems |
| `3C:5A:B4` | Apple, Inc. |
| `44:85:00` | Samsung Electronics |
| `AC:DE:48` | Private/Virtual MAC (used by VMware, etc.) |

## 🔹 OUI Lookup

You can check a MAC’s vendor by looking up its OUI:  
- `https://macvendors.com/`  
- `https://standards-oui.ieee.org/oui/oui.txt`

---

## 🔹 Notes

- Some devices **randomize MACs** for privacy (e.g., smartphones → Wi-Fi probing).  
- In such cases, the OUI may not reflect the real vendor.
