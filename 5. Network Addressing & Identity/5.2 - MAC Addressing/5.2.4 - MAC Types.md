# ðŸ”€ Types of MAC Addresses

MAC addresses can be classified based on **usage** and **bit settings** in the address.

---

## ðŸ”¹ 1. Unicast MAC
- Represents **a single device** on the network.
- Sent frames are delivered to **only that device**.
- Example: `00:1A:2B:3C:4D:5E`

---

## ðŸ”¹ 2. Multicast MAC
- Used to send frames to **a group of devices**.
- Identified when the **least significant bit (LSB) of the first byte = 1**.
- Example: `01:00:5E:00:00:FB` (used in mDNS).

---

## ðŸ”¹ 3. Broadcast MAC
- Special case of multicast.
- All bits = `FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF`
- Frames sent to this address are delivered to **all devices** in the local broadcast domain.

---

## ðŸ”¹ 4. Universally Administered (UAA)
- Assigned by the **device manufacturer** (based on OUI).
- Default MAC of the NIC.

---

## ðŸ”¹ 5. Locally Administered (LAA)
- Manually set by the user or OS.
- Overrides the burned-in MAC address.
- Used for:
  - Privacy/randomization.
  - Virtual machines.
  - Network testing.
