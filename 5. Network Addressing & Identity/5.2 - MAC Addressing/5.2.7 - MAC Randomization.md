# 🎭 MAC Randomization

---

## 🔹 What is MAC Randomization?
- A **privacy feature** where devices use **temporary, randomized MAC addresses** instead of their real hardware MAC.  
- Helps prevent **tracking** across different Wi-Fi networks.  
- Supported in most modern OS: Android, iOS, Windows, Linux.  

---

## 🔹 Why It’s Used
1. **Privacy Protection**  
   - Prevents advertisers, ISPs, and trackers from uniquely identifying your device.  
   - Example: Without randomization, every Wi-Fi you connect to sees the same MAC → easy to track movement.  

2. **Stronger Anonymity**  
   - Makes it harder for public Wi-Fi providers to link multiple sessions to you.  

3. **Reduces Profiling**  
   - Stops shops, airports, or cafes from analyzing your presence via Wi-Fi probe requests.  

---

## 🔹 How It Works
1. Device generates a **random MAC address**.  
2. This temporary MAC is used when:
   - Scanning for networks (probe requests).  
   - Connecting to Wi-Fi (if enabled).  
3. Real MAC address may still be used in some trusted networks.

## 🔹 Types of Randomization
- **During Scanning**  
  - Temporary MAC used only for probe requests.  
- **Per-Network**  
  - Each Wi-Fi network gets a unique randomized MAC.  
- **Always Randomized**  
  - Device never uses the real MAC except for critical functions.  

---

## 🔹 Advantages
- Strong privacy on **public hotspots**.  
- Stops cross-network tracking.  
- Makes **MAC filtering bypass harder** (if attacker doesn’t know real MAC).  

---

## 🔹 Limitations
- Some enterprise/corporate networks require **real MAC** for access control.  
- Can cause issues with:
  - **MAC-based filtering**.  
  - **Device whitelisting** on routers.  
- Randomized MACs still need to follow certain patterns → not perfect anonymity.  

---

## 🔹 How to Enable
- **Android** → Wi-Fi settings → Privacy → “Use Randomized MAC”.  
- **iOS** → Wi-Fi → (i) next to network → “Private Address”.  
- **Windows 10/11** → Settings → Network & Internet → Wi-Fi → Random hardware addresses.  
- **Linux** → `macchanger` or NetworkManager config.

## 📌 Quick Recap
| Feature         | Benefit                          | Limitation                  |
|-----------------|----------------------------------|------------------------------|
| Scanning Mode   | Stops probe-based tracking       | May still reveal real MAC    |
| Per-Network     | Each Wi-Fi sees unique identity  | Can confuse enterprise Wi-Fi |
| Always Random   | Strongest privacy                | Breaks MAC-based controls    |
