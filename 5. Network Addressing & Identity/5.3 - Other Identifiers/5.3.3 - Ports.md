## What is a Port?

A **port** is like a specific door inside our computer or device.

- Our **IP address** is your house.
- The **port** is the exact door we knock on to talk to a specific service inside that house.

When data is sent over the internet, it doesn't just go to an IP ‚Äî it also includes a **port number** so your system knows *which application* to deliver it to.

---

## Why do ports exist?

Because a single device can run multiple services at once.

For example:
- Web browser? ‚Üí Uses **Port 80** or **443**
- Remote login tool (SSH)? ‚Üí Uses **Port 22**
- Email client? ‚Üí Uses **Port 25** or **587**

Without ports, all the incoming data would be dumped in one place with no direction ‚Äî chaos.

## How many ports are there?

There are **65,536 ports total** (0 to 65535). [so many ports! üò≠]

But they‚Äôre divided into categories:

| Port Range | Name | Who Uses Them |
|------------|------|----------------|
| **0‚Äì1023** | Well-known ports | Used by system services (like HTTP, SSH, DNS) |
| **1024‚Äì49151** | Registered ports | Used by apps (like Skype, Nmap, etc.) |
| **49152‚Äì65535** | Ephemeral/Dynamic ports | Temporary ports assigned automatically by your system |

## Most common ports we‚Äôll see

| Port | Protocol | What It's For |
|------|----------|----------------|
| 20, 21 | FTP | File Transfer |
| 22 | SSH | Secure remote login |
| 23 | Telnet | Old insecure remote login |
| 25 | SMTP | Sending emails |
| 53 | DNS | Resolving domains |
| 80 | HTTP | Unencrypted websites |
| 110 | POP3 | Receiving emails |
| 443 | HTTPS | Secure websites |
| 445 | SMB | Windows file sharing |
| 3389 | RDP | Remote desktop (Windows) |

We don‚Äôt need to memorize all of them, but we *should* know ports like 22, 53, 80, and 443 early on.

## Port states

When scanning or analyzing a network, we'll run into **port states**:

| State | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| **Open** | A service is listening on that port |
| **Closed** | No service there, but port is reachable |
| **Filtered** | Something (like a firewall) is blocking access |
| **Unfiltered** | Port is accessible, but status unclear |

These help us understand how secure or exposed a system is.

## How to check open ports?

Sometimes we just wanna ask:

> "Yo, is this app or service using a port right now or not?"

***Here‚Äôs how to check:***


### On Linux (or Termux)

| What we wanna do                         | Command                           | What It Does                          |
|-------------------------------------------|------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| See open/listening ports (TCP/UDP)        | `netstat -tuln`                    | Shows ports your system is listening on |
| Same but with app/process info            | `netstat -tulnp`                   | Adds who‚Äôs using those ports           |
| Alternative to netstat (modern)           | `ss -tuln`                         | Faster tool, same info                 |
| See what process is using a port          | `lsof -i :8080`                    | Shows which app is on port 8080        |
| Scan your device for open ports           | `nmap 127.0.0.1`                   | Nmap scan on yourself (localhost)      |
| Check specific port manually              | `nc -zv 127.0.0.1 8080`            | ‚ÄúIs port 8080 open?‚Äù Yes or no         |

---

### On Windows

| What we wanna do                         | Command                           | What It Does                          |
|-------------------------------------------|------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| See ALL ports + who‚Äôs using them          | `netstat -ano`                    | Shows port + PID (Process ID)          |
| Find the app from the PID                 | `tasklist | findstr <PID>`        | Links PID to app name                  |
| Fancy method (PowerShell)                 | `Get-NetTCPConnection`            | Lists open TCP connections             |

---

### On macOS

| What we wanna do                         | Command                           | What It Does                          |
|-------------------------------------------|------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| List all open ports                       | `lsof -i`                         | See apps + ports in use                |
| See detailed net info                     | `netstat -anv`                    | All active connections (verbose)       |

---

### On Android (via Termux)

Use same commands as Linux:

```bash
netstat -tuln
lsof -i
nmap 127.0.0.1
```
---

## Why should we care?

Because tools like **Nmap**, **Wireshark**, and even **firewalls** work with ports.

We‚Äôll see stuff like:
- Port **open**
- Port **closed**
- Port **filtered**

If we‚Äôre learning cybersecurity or networking ‚Äî **ports are almost everything**.

---

## Analogy Time

Imagine our house (our device):

- IP address = our house's main address.
- Ports = individual room numbers inside the house.
- A delivery arrives (data), but unless it has a port (room number), nobody knows where to send it.

---

## Overall

- Ports = virtual entry points on our device.
- Services like web, SSH, or email each use different ports.
- We can scan ports to discover running services.
- Ports can be open, closed, or filtered.
- Tools like Nmap and Netstat help us inspect them.
