Infrared in networking? Yep, not just for your TV remote.  
Think of it as Wi-Fi’s ancient cousin who *needs* direct eye contact to work.

## 🌟 What is Infrared?
Infrared (IR) is a wireless communication method that uses **light waves** (just outside the visible spectrum).  
Basically, it’s “light-based networking” — but unlike visible light, you don’t see it shining around.  
Your remote, your old-school PDAs, early laptops with “IR ports” — all were fans.

## ⚙️ How it works
- Data is sent as pulses of infrared light.  
- **Line of sight is mandatory** — if something blocks the beam, communication dies instantly.  
- Usually works within a short range (a few meters).  
- Speed? Not impressive by today’s standards. Think **kB/s to a few Mbps** in best-case setups.  

Imagine two people trying to talk with flashlights in a dark room — but if someone walks between them, conversation over.

## 📱 Where was it used?
- **TV remotes** (obviously).  
- **Early mobile phones & laptops** (yep, people “beamed” contacts over IR before Bluetooth existed).  
- **Printers & handheld devices** in the 90s/2000s.  
- Some medical and industrial tools still use it because it’s cheap & isolated.

Basically, IR was the “Bluetooth” of its time — only way fussier.

## 👍 Pros
- Simple and cheap.  
- Secure-ish — since you need physical line of sight, no random dude across the street can hijack it.  
- Doesn’t interfere with radio-based systems.  

---

## 👎 Cons
- **Line of sight drama.** Move your hand in the way? Connection gone.  
- Slow compared to Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, LTE, you name it.  
- Limited range — you can’t beam files across the room unless you walk closer.  
- Basically dead in modern networking (except remotes).

## 🤔 Fun Fact
Some laptops literally had an “Infrared Port” on the side — people would sit awkwardly aligning devices to transfer a 2MB file.  
By the time it was done, you’d probably wish you’d carried a floppy disk instead.  

---

## TL;DR
Infrared = Light-based networking that *only worked if you stared directly into each other’s eyes*.  
Cool for the 90s, nostalgic now, replaced by Bluetooth & Wi-Fi.
