When you hear *microwave*, you probably think “leftover biryani.”  
But in networking, microwaves are **high-frequency radio waves** that carry data over **long distances**.  

They’re like the older cousin of radio waves:  
- Faster ✅  
- More direct ✅  
- But also more high-maintenance ❌

## ⚡ What are Microwaves?
- Electromagnetic waves with **higher frequency than radio** (typically 1 GHz – 300 GHz).  
- Can transmit *tons* of data quickly.  
- Travel in **straight lines** (line of sight).  
- Used when cables are too expensive or too much hassle.  

Basically: “Why dig a trench for fiber when I can just beam data across the city like a Star Wars laser?”

## 🛰️ How it works
1. Data is encoded into microwave signals.  
2. Signals travel through the air in **narrow beams**.  
3. Big dish antennas (those giant plates on towers) catch and forward the signals.  
4. Repeaters boost the signal across long distances.  

So it’s like a **relay race in the sky** — dishes passing data batons.

## 📍 Where do we use microwaves?
- **Satellite communication** (TV, GPS, internet beaming from space).  
- **Cell towers** (microwave links between towers).  
- **Radar systems** (planes, weather, military).  
- **Long-distance internet backhaul** (cities, remote villages, offshore rigs).  

---

## 👍 Pros
- High bandwidth (can carry a LOT of data).  
- Long range (crosses cities, even continents with satellites).  
- No need to dig and lay cables.  
- Can connect remote areas easily.  

---

## 👎 Cons
- Needs **line of sight** (trees, buildings, or even heavy rain = bad day).  
- Expensive antennas and setup.  
- Interference from weather (rain fade is real 🌧️📡).  
- Latency in satellites (ever seen awkward Zoom delays? yeah).

## 🤔 Fun Fact
Microwave towers were once the **backbone of telephone networks** before fiber-optic cables took over.  
So next time you see a tall tower with dishes, salute it — it carried someone’s “hello?” in the 80s.

## TL;DR
Microwaves = radio waves on steroids.  
Fast, powerful, long-distance — but moody when a cloud shows up. ☁️📶
