# Satellites (a.k.a. Space WiFi)

When cables can’t reach… when towers give up… when villages are too remote…  
We look up and say: “Yo Space, help me out.” 🛰️

That’s where **satellite communication** comes in — beaming signals across the **entire planet**.

## 🪐 What is Satellite Communication?
- A satellite is basically a **space mirror for signals**.  
- It catches signals from Earth → boosts them → beams them back down.  
- Works using **microwaves** (remember them? the burrito ones, but in space).  

Think of it as:  
Earth Tower 1 📡 → 🚀 Satellite 🛰️ → 📡 Earth Tower 2

## 🛰️ Types of Satellites
1. **GEO (Geostationary Orbit)**  
   - Orbits at ~36,000 km.  
   - Always “fixed” above one spot.  
   - Great for TV, but has noticeable lag. (Ever said “hello?” twice on a video call? yeah.)  

2. **LEO (Low Earth Orbit)**  
   - Orbits ~500–2000 km.  
   - Moves fast around Earth, so you need a whole *constellation* of them.  
   - Super low latency. (Starlink, OneWeb 🚀)  

3. **MEO (Medium Earth Orbit)**  
   - Between LEO and GEO.  
   - Used for GPS (your Google Maps lifeline).

## Where do we use Satellites?
- **Internet in remote areas** (deserts, mountains, oceans).  
- **Television broadcasting** (DTH, live matches, news).  
- **Global positioning (GPS)**.  
- **Military & weather monitoring**.  
- **Disaster recovery** (when floods/earthquakes wipe out ground networks).  

Basically: anywhere normal cables say “nah bro, not going there.”  

---

## 👍 Pros
- Coverage = entire planet (no “dead zones”).  
- Perfect for remote areas, ships, planes.  
- Useful when ground networks are destroyed.  
- Can handle large-scale broadcasting easily.  

---

## 👎 Cons
- Expensive to launch and maintain (rockets aren’t cheap 🚀💸).  
- Weather interference (rain fade strikes again).  
- GEO satellites = high latency (awkward Zoom pauses).  
- Signal can be jammed or intercepted.

## 🤯 Fun Fact
Some satellites are literally **space junk now** — retired, floating, just chilling.  
So Earth has a Wi-Fi graveyard orbit. 👻🛰️

---

## TL;DR
Satellites = space routers.  
They cover everywhere, but come with lag, cost, and moody weather problems.  
Still, without them, your plane Wi-Fi and GPS would just be… imagination. 🛩️📶
